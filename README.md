First plural sight tutorial I completed, did so after having finished my senior capstone and was not completely satisfied
with what I had done and wanted more exposure with ASP.NET using the MVC design pattern. 

Initially did this using VSTS but am uploading a version that runs through git bash,
as I ran it, aside from being simple the globe icon on the
nav bar does nothing as well as artist im following.

somewhere in here there is a powerpoint file with a video of the site running.
